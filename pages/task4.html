                    Young chess enthusiasts are getting ready for an exciting game! With concentration and
                    enthusiasm,
                    they’re eager to start their first match.Chess is a great way to develop critical thinking,
                    memory, and concentration in young children. Chess notation systems are used to record either
                    the moves made or the position of the pieces in a game of chess. Chess notation is used in chess
                    literature, and by players keeping a record of an ongoing game. The earliest systems of notation
                    used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into more compact
                    notation systems. Algebraic notation is now the accepted international standard, with several
                    variants. Descriptive chess notation was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until
                    the late 20th century, but is now obsolescent. Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a text file
                    format based on English algebraic notation which can be processed by most chess software. Other
                    notation systems include ICCF numeric notation, used for international correspondence chess, and
                    systems for transmission using Morse code over telegraph or radio. The standard system for
                    recording chess positions is Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN).
