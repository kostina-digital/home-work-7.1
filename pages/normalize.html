            <p>
                Chess is a great way to develop critical thinking, memory, and concentration in young children.
                Chess notation systems are used to record either the moves made or the position of the pieces in a game
                of
                chess. Chess notation is used in chess literature, and by players keeping a record of an ongoing game.
                The
                earliest systems of notation used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into
                more compact notation systems. Algebraic notation is now the accepted international standard, with
                several
                variants. Descriptive chess notation was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until the late
                20th century, but is now obsolescent.
                Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a text file format based on English
                algebraic notation which can be processed by most chess software.
                Other notation systems include ICCF
                numeric notation, used for international correspondence chess, and systems for transmission using Morse
                code
                over telegraph or radio. The standard system for recording chess positions is Forsyth–Edwards Notation
                (FEN).
