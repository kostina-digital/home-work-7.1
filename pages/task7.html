                memory, and concentration in young children. Chess notation systems are used to record either
                the moves made or the position of the pieces in a game of chess. Chess notation is used in chess
                literature, and by players keeping a record of an ongoing game. The earliest systems of notation
                used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into more compact
                notation systems. Algebraic notation is now the accepted international standard, with several
                variants. Descriptive chess notation was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until
                the late 20th century, but is now obsolescent. Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a text file
                format based on English algebraic notation which can be processed by most chess software. Other
                notation systems include ICCF numeric notation, used for international correspondence chess, and
                systems for transmission using Morse code over telegraph or radio. The standard system for
                recording chess positions is Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN).Young chess enthusiasts are getting
